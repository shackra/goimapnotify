This application is mostly compatible with the configuration of [imapnotify made with Python](https://github.com/a-sk/python-imapnotify) (be sure to change `password_eval` to `passwordCMD`, see [issue #3](https://gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify/issues/3)), the following are all options available for the configuration:

```json
[
    {
      "host": "example.com",
      "port": 143,
      "tls": true,
      "tlsOptions": {
        "rejectUnauthorized": false,
        "starttls": true
      },
      "username": "USERNAME",
      "alias": "ExampleCOM",
      "password": "PASSWORD",
      "xoAuth2": false,
      "boxes": [
            {
                "mailbox" : "INBOX",
                "onNewMail": "mbsync examplecom:INBOX",
                "onNewMailPost": "SKIP"
            }
      ]
    },
    {
      "hostCMD": "COMMAND_TO_RETRIEVE_HOST",
      "port": 993,
      "tls": true,
      "tlsOptions": {
        "rejectUnauthorized": true,
        "starttls": true
      },
      "username": "",
      "usernameCMD": "",
      "password": "",
      "passwordCMD": "",
      "xoAuth2": false,
      "onNewMail": "",
      "onNewMailPost": "",
      "onDeletedMail": "",
      "onDeletedMailPost": "",
      "boxes": [
            {
                "mailbox" : "INBOX",
                "onNewMail": "mbsync examplenet:INBOX",
                "onNewMailPost": "SKIP"
            },
            {
                "mailbox" : "Junk",
                "onNewMail": "mbsync examplenet:Junk",
                "onNewMailPost": "SKIP"
            }
      ]
    }
]
```

On first start, the application will run `onNewMail` and `onNewMailPost` and then wait for events from your IMAP server.

- `onNewMail`: is an executable or script to run when new mail has arrived.
- `onNewMailPost`: is an executable or script to run after `onNewMail` has ran.
- `onDeletedMail`: is an executable or script to run when mail has been delete.
- `onDeletedMailPost`: is an executable or script to run after `onDeletedMail` has ran.
- `hostCMD`: is an executable or script that retrieves your host from somewhere, we cannot pass arguments to this command from `Stdin`.
- `usernameCMD`: is an executable or script that retrieves your username from somewhere, we cannot pass arguments to this command from `Stdin`.
- `passwordCMD`: is an executable or script that retrieves your password from somewhere, we cannot pass arguments to this command from `Stdin`.
- `xoAuth2`: is an option that allow us to login on your IMAP using OAuth2, **be aware**: the token is retrieve from `passwordCMD` (see shackra/goimapnotify#9).
- `wait`: is the delay in seconds before the mail syncing is trigger (see shackra/goimapnotify#10).

The application will use TLS as long as the IMAP server advertises this capability. If you use self-signed certificates or something, be sure to set `rejectUnauthorized` as `false`.

If your host do not offer IDLE, a sane default of checking every 15 minutes will take place instead.

You can also use xoAuth2 instead of password based authentication by setting the `xoAuth2` option to `true` and the output of a tool which can provide xoAuth2 encoded tokens in `passwordCMD`. Examples: [Google oauth2l](https://github.com/google/oauth2l) or [xoauth2 fetcher for O365](https://github.com/harishkrupo/oauth2ms).

## Install

    go install gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify@latest

## Usage

    Usage of goimapnotify:
      -conf string
            Configuration file (default "${HOME}/.config/goimapnotify/goimapnotify.conf")
      -debug
            Output all network activity to the terminal (!! this won't leak your credentials !!)
      -list
            List all mailboxes and exit
      -wait int
            Period in seconds between IDLE event and execution of scripts (default 1)

As you can notice, `-list` can help you figure out the mailbox hierarchy of your mail server.

# Development
nix-flake is use for development, is great and [you should try it](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer?tab=readme-ov-file#the-determinate-nix-installer) too! Activate support for flake in your nix installation and the environment will setup âœ¨*automagically*âœ¨ for you.

## Generating and editing the CHANGELOG
When I started this project, I was naive and inexperienced with the fundamentals of software development, that has make most commits in this project have inconsistent titles that make it harder for tools like [`git-chglog`](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog) help with CHANGELOG generation. I generated an ["old" CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG_old.md) that contains all information until tag `2.3.13`. So, from now on, generate the CHANGELOG from tag `2.3.14` onwards, please and thank you!.
